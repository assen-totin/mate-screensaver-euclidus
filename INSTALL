REQUIREMENTS
============

1. GTK+ 2.0

2. OpenGL

3. OpenGL-GTK-X11

4. pkg-config.  

5. gcc. 

6. make from autoconf tools.


INSTALLATION
============

1. ./configure

2. make

3. (as root) make install


BUILDING RPM
============

Two ways to build an RPM file: 

1. Outside the source tree: 
- ./configure
- Use the created mate-screensaver-euclidus.spec to build the RPM

2. Inside the source tree:
- Edit the mate-screensaver-euclidus.spec and coment out the two lines in the begining of the file (read comments for details)
- ./configure && make && make rpm

Also, for rpm you'd probably like to call ./configure this way:
     ./configure --prefix=/usr


UNINSTALL
=========

make uninstall
